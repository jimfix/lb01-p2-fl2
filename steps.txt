0. "Accept an assignment" -> creates a remote repo just for you (private)
1. "git clone" your own repo to get a local copy on your machine
2. edit/add to that repo (locally)
3. "git add" all the files you've created/changed to stage the commit
4. "git commit" with a brief message (still local)
(can repeat 2-3-4 several times)
5. "git push origin master" those changes to the remote
6. then you'll make a "pull request"
